			        The timescale of a website design project is often dictated by the client. If you have a deadline in mind we will make every effort to meet it for you. The most common delay in the creation and completion of a new website is waiting for content (text/images) to be sent to us by the client. For most projects, we try to work within the 4-6 week time-frame.

			        In the majority of cases a meeting isn’t necessary and most of our websites are generally completed with contact via email and telephone only. We place suggested website designs online via, our  secure testing server for you to view the work in progress. This way we can have regular communication to ensure you are getting exactly what you expect

			        It is helpful to us if you are able to provide text and photographs in electronic form – for example, the files output by a digital camera and the copy in MS word or similar format. If this is not possible, we can help get your information ready for use on the website. We will also provide you instructions on how to upload the material via FTP or email.

If you give us a call we will be pleased to discuss with you,  your website design requirements and give you a quotation based on your unique needs.
